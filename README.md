# Celebrity Hub — Starter Project

Overview
--------
A dark-themed, professional "Celebrity Hub" static website. The project includes:
- `index.html` — main hub listing celebrity cards in a responsive grid
- `pages/keanu.html` — an example celebrity profile page (Keanu Reeves / "Families Only")
- `pages/template-celebrity.html` — template you can copy & edit for other celebrities
- `css/styles.css` — site styles (responsive + animations)
- `js/script.js` — interactive features (modal contact form, gallery lightbox, form validation)

How to deploy to GitHub Pages (quick)
------------------------------------
1. Create a GitHub account at https://github.com if you don't have one.
2. Create a new repository (e.g., `celebrity-hub`) and upload these files.
3. In the repo on GitHub -> Settings -> Pages -> Source -> choose `main` branch and `/ (root)` -> Save.
4. Your site will be live at `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/celebrity-hub/` shortly.

Notes
-----
- Replace placeholder images in `/assets/` with real photos.
- Update `js/script.js` -> `FORM_ACTION_URL` with your Formspree or backend endpoint to enable contact form sending.
- Edit pages in `pages/` to add real bios, works, and video links.
